# CSC1024-Assignment (50% Weightage)
### Assignment for CSC1024 - Programming Principles; September 2023 Term.

### Development of A Personal Book Management System using Python.

### This README is intended for my groupmates in this assignment to explain workflow and code production.

Most technicalities have already been discussed in-person. Thus, this README only serves to act as a general guideline for our assignment.



## Contributing to the Code

- Individual functional segment files have been created in the repository under ./Function-Segments and have been named accordingly. 
- You may contribute via editing/pushing into your individual functional files.

! IMPORTANT: You should only edit your individual function files in ./Function-Segments. When editing the text file, you should also only edit the one contained in the ./Function-Segments file. The .py and .txt file contained in the home file are our FINAL deliverable files and should only be edited by me (Darrance) for the final compilation and editing.
> When opening the text file, use "with open("books_23094907.txt") as my_file:"



## Error Handling

- **THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.**
- The program **SHOULD ONLY END WHEN WE RUN THE exit_program() FUNCTION.**
- Everyone should make sure to handle ALL errors and make sure the program handles ALL exceptions even if the user inputs an inappropriate input.
> Everyone should implement try-except AT ALL TIMES to handle error and exceptions.
> When using try-except error handling, remember to add comments and documentation to specify what type of errors you are catching.



## Report Writing

- To promote fairness in contribution, everyone is encouraged to contribute equally into the writing of the final report.
- Everyone is to be responsible to their individual parts for the report.
- For reference regarding your individual report contents. Refer to the image below.

You are expected to be as detailed as possible when it comes to describing your functions to prove you understand the topic and contents.



## Flowcharts

- Similar to report writing, everyone is expected to draw the flowcharts for their own individual functions.
- You may refer to the lecture slides and **ensure** all symbols and logic are implemented correctly.
- Everyone is to submit their individual flowcharts to me (Darrance) latest by **8<sup>th</sup> December 2023**. This is to allow us time for error checking and fixing as well as allow me more breathing room for the final compilation.



## Code Documentation

- Code Commenting, Identifier Names and Code Readability are all critiera in the grading scheme.
- For the sake of uniformity and readability, everyone is expected to integrate the [PEP-8 Styling Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) when it comes to naming files, functions, etc...
> Example of PEP-8 function naming: my_function():
- Everyone is reminded and encouraged to provide clear descriptions and comments of their code.
- You may refer to a snapshot of the PEP-8 naming convention below.

## Task Distribution and Project Roadmap

- We will be using the [Projects](https://github.com/users/darrancebeh/projects/2/views/1) function on GitHub to track our project progress.

- Tasks have already been assigned according to the task distribution discussed previously in-person.
- You can change your progress by holding the tabs and dragging it into the respective tabs.



## Deadlines

- The deadline for the assignment is on the **11<sup>th</sup> December 2023**.
- However, for optimal results and to make the overall process smoother and seamless, everyone is expected to complete any individual tasks at least 3 days before the deadline.
